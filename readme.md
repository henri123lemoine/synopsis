# synopsis.py

Small script to speed-copy some subset of files from a project into an into an
LLM, and to quickly edit what's included in the subset.

## Installation

```sh
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/FraserLee/synopsis

# make the script executable
cd synopsis
chmod +x synopsis.py

# Add an alias to the script.
echo "alias synopsis='$(pwd)/synopsis.py'" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# Add .llm_info to global gitignore.
echo ".llm_info" >> ~/.gitignore
```

## Usage

```sh
synopsis # copy every file listed in `.llm_info`, wrapped in code blocks, to
         # the clipboard.

synopsis --edit # interactively add and remove files from `.llm_info`

# by default, the interactive selector shows only git-tracked files and hides
# ignored/untracked files (e.g., __pycache__, build artifacts). Use --all to
# include everything.
synopsis --edit --all
```

This creates a file, `.llm_info`, which looks like

```txt
file1.md
foo/bar/file2.py
etc.
```

The clipboard output is formatted as

````markdown
file1.md
```markdown
file 1 contents
```

foo/bar/file2.py
```python
file 2 contents
```

etc.
````

## Possible Future Plans

**Project motivation:** I tried Cursor for about half an hour earlier this
afternoon, and I'm pretty unimpressed compared to what's achievable by just
copy-pasting entire files into a chat prompt. I only wrote this to accelerate
that process a bit, so plans for the future are pretty limited.

That said, it might be worthwhile to query to some weaker model to summarize
files that are too long to copy in full - pulling out externally visible
functions and types, and any important context - then caching the response by
the file hash. Then again, context windows are pretty long these days, so a
complete project dump might be fine for everything I'm looking to do, too.
